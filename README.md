Some python scripts used to simplify some personal tasks.

### encripta_desencripta.py

This script was made as an exercise for a college course, regarding security.
Although it is a bit simple, it was made to make it simple to understand how encryption and decryption work.

### facturacion_fields_creator.py

Using the facturacion_fields_creator script, it was simpler to create Java components for an existing project called "Facturacion". By the time this script was written, it took only a few seconds to create new Java components, vs writing the raw code for each component.
